This is a neuroevolution project that utilizes evolutionary algorithms to generate neural networks (related to the players) parameters that eventually learn to play the game.

## Neuroevolution
### The Neural Network
The nn.py is where I implemented the neural network (the weights and biases initializations, activation function(s), and feed forward). As mentioned before, each player (created by the evolutionary algorithm and together they form a whole generation) is associated with a neural network (with its specific parameters).
